## About AWAR

AWAR (Animal Welfare and Rescue) is a centralised web platform to help animal rescues save time, improve operations, and match animals with loving homes faster.

We believe every rescue animal deserves a loving home, and AWAR makes that journey smoother for animal rescue teams. Our mission is to provide a powerful, easy-to-use CRM designed specifically for animal rescue organisation, empowering them to save time on administration and focus on what matters most - caring for the animals.
